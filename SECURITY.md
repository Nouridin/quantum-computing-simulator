# Security Policy

## Introduction

The Quantum Computing Simulator project takes security seriously. This document outlines our security policy and provides guidance on reporting vulnerabilities, our disclosure process, and security best practices for the project.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| < latest | :x:               |

We provide security updates only for the latest version of the software. Users are encouraged to keep their installations updated.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Quantum Computing Simulator, please report it by emailing us at **[security@example.com]**. 

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

### What to Include in Your Report

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Affected versions
- Any potential mitigations or workarounds
- If applicable, proof of concept code or screenshots

### Encryption

To securely communicate the vulnerability details, you may use our PGP key to encrypt your message:

```
[PGP KEY HERE]
```

## Vulnerability Assessment and Response

### Initial Response

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.

### Assessment Process

After receiving a report, our security team will:

1. Confirm the vulnerability and determine its impact
2. Develop a fix and create a timeline for release
3. Prepare a security advisory as needed

### Disclosure Timeline

We follow a coordinated disclosure process:

1. **0-48 hours:** Initial acknowledgment of the report
2. **2-7 days:** Vulnerability assessment and confirmation
3. **7-30 days:** Develop and test a fix (timeline depends on complexity)
4. **30-60 days:** Release a patch and public disclosure (sooner if possible)

We may adjust this timeline based on the severity of the vulnerability and other factors.

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- Keep your installation updated to the latest version
- Review permissions for imported/exported circuits
- Be cautious when importing QASM code from untrusted sources
- Monitor the project's security advisories

### For Contributors

- Follow secure coding practices outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Never commit sensitive data, credentials, or personal information
- Use proper validation for user inputs, especially in the QASM parser
- Be careful when implementing quantum algorithms with cryptographic relevance

## Web Application Security

As a browser-based application, we implement the following security measures:

- Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent XSS attacks
- Proper CORS configuration
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities

## Special Considerations for Quantum Computing

### Cryptographic Implications

While our simulator is designed for educational purposes, we recognize the potential cryptographic implications of quantum computing. We commit to:

- Clearly documenting the cryptographic limitations of simulated quantum algorithms
- Providing educational resources on post-quantum cryptography
- Responsibly implementing quantum algorithms with cryptographic relevance

### Data Privacy

- User circuit designs and simulation results are processed locally
- No sensitive quantum algorithm data is transmitted without explicit user consent
- Users should be aware of browser storage limitations when working with sensitive algorithms

## Security Updates

Security updates will be announced through:

- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes
- Project website (if applicable)

## Recognition

We believe in acknowledging security researchers who help improve our security. With your permission, we will recognize your contribution in our release notes and/or security advisories.

## Changes to this Policy

This security policy may be updated or revised from time to time. The latest version will always be available in the repository.

## Contact

If you have any questions about this security policy, please contact us at **[security@example.com]**.
